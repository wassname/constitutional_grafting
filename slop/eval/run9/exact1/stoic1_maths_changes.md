A company's HR hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?

### Fresh Instruct: predNone; correctFalse; finishlength

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to determine the number of employees present in each of the three months and then calculate the total salary payout for that period.

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees for each month.**
*   **Initial State:** The company starts with 200 employees.
*   **Hiring Rate:** 20 new employees are hired every month.
*   **Month 1:** The company starts with the initial 200 employees. The 20 new hires are added during this month (or at the start of the next, but typically in these problems, we count the workforce active during the month). Let's assume the 20 new hires join at the beginning of the month or are paid for that month.
    *   Employees in Month 1 = Initial (200) + New Hires (20) = 220 employees.
    *   *Alternative Interpretation Check:* Does "hires 20 new employees every month" mean they are added *after* the month? Usually, "hires... to add to its total workforce" implies the workforce grows. Let's look at the standard progression:
        *   Start of Month 1: 200 employees.
        *   During Month 1: 20 hired. Total active for Month 1 payroll = 200 + 20 = 220? Or is it 200 for the first month, then 220 for the second?
        *   Let's re-read carefully: "hires 20 new employees every month".
        *   Scenario A: The 20 are hired at the start of the month.
            *   Month 1: 200 (initial) + 20 (new) = 220.
            *   Month 2: 220 (previous) + 20 (new) = 240.
            *   Month 3: 240 (previous) + 20 (new) = 260.
        *   Scenario B: The 20 are hired at the end of the month (so they don't get paid for that month).
            *   Month 1: 200.
            *   Month 2: 200 + 20 = 220.
            *   Month 3: 220 + 20 = 240.

    Let's analyze the phrasing "hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce". If the goal is to calculate the total money paid *after* three months, we sum the monthly payouts.
    Standard interpretation for such arithmetic problems: The hiring happens, and the new employees are paid for the month they are hired.
    Let's assume the hiring happens at the start of the month for simplicity, or that the "total workforce" includes the new hires for that month's calculation.
    
    *Refined Logic:*
    *   **Month 1:** Start with 200. Hire 20. Total workforce = 220.
        *   Salary = $220 \times 4000$.
    *   **Month 2:** Start with 220. Hire 20. Total workforce = 240.
        *   Salary = $240 \times 4000$.
    *   **Month 3:** Start with 240. Hire 20. Total workforce = 260.
        *   Salary = $260 \times 4000$.

    *Alternative Logic (Hiring at end of month):*
    *   **Month 1:** 200 employees. (Hire 20 at end).
    *   **Month 2:** 220 employees. (Hire 20 at end).
    *   **Month 3:** 240 employees. (Hire 20 at end).
    
    Which is more likely? "Hires 20... every month". If I hire someone today, they usually work and get paid for the current month. If the problem meant they start next month, it would usually specify "at the end of the month". However, let's look at the "initial employee number is 200".
    If the company *starts* with 200, and *then* hires 20, the first month's payroll is likely based on the 200 existing + 20 new.
    Let's try the calculation with the "Start of Month" assumption (Scenario A) as it represents the full growth of the workforce described.
    
    *Wait, let's reconsider the "Initial" vs "Hires" timeline.*
    If the company has 200 employees *initially* (Time 0).
    Month 1: They have 200. They hire 20. Do the 20 get paid in Month 1?
    If the question implies a steady state where the workforce grows, the most standard interpretation is:
    Month 1 Payroll: 200 (initial) + 20 (new) = 220.
    Month 2 Payroll: 220 + 20 = 240.
    Month 3 Payroll: 240 + 20 = 260.
    
    Let's try the other interpretation (Scenario B) just in case.
    Month 1: 200.
    Month 2: 220.
    Month 3: 240.
    
    Let's look for clues in similar problems. Usually, "hires X every month" implies the headcount increases by X for that month's calculation. If you hire someone, you pay them.
    Let's assume the 20 new employees are paid for the month they are hired.
    
    **Calculation (Scenario A - New hires paid in the month of hiring):**
    *   **Month 1:**
        *   Employees: $200 + 20 = 220$
        *   Cost: $220 \times 4000 = 880,000$
    *   **Month 2:**
        *   Employees: $220 + 20 = 240$
        *   Cost: $240 \times 4000 = 960,000$
    *   **Month 3:**
        *   Employees: $240 + 20 = 260$
        *   Cost: $260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000$

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to determine the number of employees present in each of the three months and then calculate the total salary payout for that period.

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees in each month.**
*   **Initial State:** The company starts with 200 employees.
*   **Hiring Rate:** 20 new employees are hired every month.
*   **Month 1:**
    *   Employees at the start: 200.
    *   New hires during the month: 20.
    *   Total employees working in Month 1: $200 + 20 = 220$.
    *   *Note: The problem implies the new hires are paid for the month they are hired. Even if they are hired at the end, standard word problems of this type usually assume the workforce count for the month includes the new additions, or we calculate the sum of salaries for the specific headcount active during that month. Let's assume the 20 new hires are paid for that month.*
*   **Month 2:**
    *   Employees from Month 1: 220.
    *   New hires during the month: 20.
    *   Total employees working in Month 2: $220 + 20 = 240$.
*   **Month 3:**
    *   Employees from Month 2: 240.
    *   New hires during the month: 20.
    *   Total employees working in Month 3: $240 + 20 = 260$.

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary cost for each month.**
The salary per employee is $4,000 per month.

*   **Cost for Month 1:**
    $220 \text{ employees} \times \$4,000 = \$880,000$

*   **Cost for Month 2:**
    $240 \text{ employees} \times \$4,000 = \$960,000$

*   **Cost for Month 3:**
    $260 \text{ employees} \times \$4,000 = \$1,040,000$

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over the three months.**
Total Cost = (Month 1 Cost) + (Month 2 Cost) + (Month 3 Cost)
Total Cost = $\$880,000 + \$960,000 + \$1,040,000$

Let's sum them up:
$880,000 + 960,000 = 1,840,000$
$1,840,000 + 1,040,000 = 2,880,000$

**Alternative Calculation Method (Sum of employees first):**
Total employees paid over 3 months = $220 + 240 + 260 = 720$ employee-months.
Total Cost = $720 \times \$4,000 = \$2,880,000$.

Both methods yield the same result.
